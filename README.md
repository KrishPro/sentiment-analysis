# Sentiment Analysis (BERT from Scratch)
**This is a Failed Experiment.**

## Architecture
![Bert](Assets/bert.png)
I created BERT and directly started to train on sentiment analysis without any kind of pre-training But that didn't seem to work

## Results
```
EPOCH 1: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:31<00:00,  4.35it/s, loss=0.356]
EPOCH 2: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:27<00:00,  4.40it/s, loss=0.522]
EPOCH 3: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:28<00:00,  4.39it/s, loss=0.411]
EPOCH 4: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:28<00:00,  4.38it/s, loss=0.536]
EPOCH 5: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:28<00:00,  4.39it/s, loss=0.427]
EPOCH 6: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:29<00:00,  4.38it/s, loss=0.49]
EPOCH 7: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:29<00:00,  4.38it/s, loss=0.459]
EPOCH 8: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:29<00:00,  4.38it/s, loss=0.426]
EPOCH 9: 100%|██████████| 1442/1442 [05:29<00:00,  4.38it/s, loss=0.504]
EPOCH 10:  84%|████████▍ | 1211/1442 [04:35<00:52,  4.40it/s, loss=0.577]
```

Even after running for ~50 mins on Google Colab, It didn't seem to converge so i didn't trainned it any further

## Demo
As it didn't produced any results, I didn't made any demo for it
Even, I didn't saved the trainned weights
